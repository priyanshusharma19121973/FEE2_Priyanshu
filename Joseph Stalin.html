            Widely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of the working class and socialism.

            Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[f] (born Jugashvili;[g] 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who was the longest-serving leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (head of government) from 1941 until his death. Initially governing the country as part of a collective leadership, Stalin consolidated his power within the party and state to become a dictator by the 1930s. Ideologically, he formalised his Leninist interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system which he established is known as Stalinism.

            In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front.[303] Despite intelligence agencies repeatedly warning him of Germany's intentions, Stalin was taken by surprise.[304] He formed a State Defense Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander,[305] as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka),[306] with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff.[307] The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days.[308] The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory;[309] soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege;[310] and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities.[311] By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow,[310] and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on the capital. Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although Stalin decided to remain in Moscow, believing his flight would damage troop morale.[312] The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions

                Early Life

            <article>
                Born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili to a cobbler and a house cleaner in Gori in what was then the Russian Empire, Stalin grew up in the city and attended school there before moving to Tiflis to join Tiflis Theological Seminary. While a student at the seminary, he embraced Marxism and became an avid follower of Vladimir Lenin before leaving the seminary to become a revolutionary. After being marked by the Okhrana for his activities, he became a full-time revolutionary and was involved in a various criminal activities as a robber, gangster and arsonist.[1] He became one of the Bolsheviks' chief operatives in the Caucasus, organizing paramilitaries, spreading propaganda and raising money through bank robberies, kidnappings and extortion. Stalin was captured and exiled to Siberia numerous times but often escaped. He became one of Lenin's closest associates, which helped him rise to the heights of power after the Russian Revolution. In 1913, Stalin was exiled to Siberia for the final time and remained in exile until the February Revolution of 1917 led to the overthrow of the Russian Empire. According to Oleg Khlevniuk, Stalin "filled an important role [in the October Revolution]",[2] and Stephen Kotkin similarly noted Stalin had been "in the thick of events" in the build-up.[3]
